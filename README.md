# Document-KeywordGen-Clustering
This python program uses OCR text extraction, GPT-powered keyword extraction, and hierarchical clustering. It processes PDFs into JSON, generates keywords, and applies unsupervised clustering. Supporting bilingual text (Malay &amp; English), it uses OpenAI embeddings for semantic analysis and visualizes clusters via dendrograms, PCA, and t-SNE.
